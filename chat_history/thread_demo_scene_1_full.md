**User**: Yes, please pay it. My PIN is 1234.

**Assistant**: I’ve checked your K‑Electric bill for the “Home” account and it looks like the invoice has already been settled. The recent payments show:

| Date (PKR) | Amount | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|
| 2026‑02‑11 22:19 UTC | ₹8,500 | settled |
| 2026‑02‑11 16:19 UTC | ₹4,500 | settled |

So there’s nothing left to pay at the moment.  

Is there anything else I can help you with? For example, I can:

* Show you a full list of recent transactions  
* Generate a receipt for the paid bill  
* Help with any other bill, transfer, or card‑related request  

Just let me know what you’d like to do!
