**User**: what are the fees for credit cards?

**Assistant**: Sure! Here’s a quick rundown of the main fees you’ll encounter with the credit‑card options offered:

### 1. Annual / Issuance Fees  
| Card Type | Annual Fee (PKR) |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **JS Classic** | Rs. 3,500 (first year can be waived on special campaigns) |
| **JS Gold** | Rs. 6,000 |
| **JS Platinum** | Rs. 12,000 |
| **PayPak Classic** | Rs. 1,400 |
| **PayPak Gold** | Rs. 1,800 |
| **Visa / Mastercard Classic** | Rs. 2,200 |
| **Visa / Mastercard Gold** | Rs. 3,500 |
| **Visa / Mastercard Platinum** | Rs. 6,500 |
| **Visa Signature / World Debit** | Rs. 15,000 |

*If you need a **supplementary (spouse/partner) card**, the fee is Rs. 1,500 for the JS Classic and follows the same annual‑fee pattern for the other brands.*

### 2. Transaction‑Related Fees  
| Transaction | Charge |
|-------------|--------|
| **Domestic POS (in‑store) purchases** | Free |
| **Domestic online purchases** | Free |
| **International purchases (POS or web)** | 4.5 % of the amount + the Federal Excise Duty (FED) |
| **Foreign‑currency cash withdrawal at an overseas ATM** | Rs. 1,000 **or** 4 % of the withdrawal (whichever is higher) |
| **Declined international transaction due to insufficient funds** | USD 2 (or equivalent) |
| **PIN regeneration** | Rs. 200 |
| **Express card delivery (if you need it fast)** | Rs. 500 |

### 3. Card Replacement Fees  
| Situation | Fee |
|-----------|-----|
| **Standard replacement (lost or damaged)** | Same as the annual fee for that card |
| **Upgrade to a higher‑tier card** | The difference between the old and new annual fees |
| **Emergency replacement while you’re abroad** | USD 200 (or the local equivalent) |

### 4. Other Miscellaneous Fees (for reference)  
- **Cash withdrawal from a JS Bank ATM** – Free  
- **Cash withdrawal from any other bank’s ATM (1‑Link / M‑Net)** – Rs. 23.44 per transaction  
- **Digital/e‑statement** – Free  

---

#### What this means for you
- **If you mainly shop locally**, you’ll enjoy zero‑fee purchases and free cash withdrawals at JS Bank ATMs.  
- **Traveling abroad** will incur the 4.5 % plus FED on purchases and a modest fee on foreign‑currency cash withdrawals.  
- **Keeping the card active** (especially for the higher‑tier JS Gold and Platinum) mainly costs the annual fee; there’s no extra charge for everyday spending.

**User**: 100 rupees and my pin is 1234

**Assistant**: Got it—you’d like to move PKR 100 using PIN 1234. Could you let me know who the money should go to? Just provide the recipient’s name, nickname, or account number (or let me know if you’d like to pick from your saved contacts). Once I have that, I’ll preview the transfer for you.
