**Assistant**: Sure thing! I can help you send 100 PKR, but I’ll need to know who you’d like to transfer the money to. Could you please provide the recipient’s name, nickname, or account number (or let me know if you’d like me to look up a saved contact for you)?

**User**: what are the fees for credit cards?

**Assistant**: **Credit‑card fees in plain language**

Below is a quick‑look guide to the most common charges you’ll see on a JS Bank credit card. Think of it as a “price‑list” that tells you what you’ll pay for keeping the card, using it abroad, and handling a few special situations.

---

### 1. Annual / Issuance fees (the “membership” cost)

| Card type | Annual fee (₹) | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **JS Classic** | **₹ 3,500** (first‑year waived on some campaigns) | Standard card; you can add a supplementary card for **₹ 1,500**. |
| **JS Gold** | **₹ 6,000** | Higher credit limit and extra perks. |
| **JS Platinum** | **₹ 12,000** | Premium limits and benefits. |
| **PayPak Classic** | **₹ 1,400** | Domestic network card. |
| **PayPak Gold** | **₹ 1,800** |
| **Visa / Mastercard Classic** | **₹ 2,200** |
| **Visa / Mastercard Gold** | **₹ 3,500** |
| **Visa / Mastercard Platinum** | **₹ 6,500** |
| **Visa Signature / World Debit** | **₹ 15,000** | Highest‑tier debit card (often bundled with credit‑card‑like features). |

*If you need a replacement card (lost or damaged), the charge is the same as the annual fee for that card type.*

---

### 2. Transaction‑related fees

| Situation | How it’s charged |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **International purchase (POS or online)** | **4.5 % of the transaction amount + FED** (foreign‑exchange duty). |
| **Cash withdrawal in a foreign currency (at an overseas ATM)** | **₹ 1,000 OR 4 % of the amount, whichever is higher**. |
| **International transaction declined because of insufficient funds** | **USD 2 (or equivalent in PKR)**. |
| **PIN regeneration (if you forget or want to change it)** | **₹ 200**. |
| **Express delivery of a new card** | **₹ 500** (standard delivery is free). |
| **Emergency card replacement while you’re abroad** | **USD 200 (or equivalent)**. |

*Domestic purchases (both in‑store and online) are free of extra charges.*

---

### 3. Other occasional costs you might see

| Service | Fee |
|---------|-----|
| **Card activation at a branch** | **Free** (you can also activate via ATM or the mobile app). |
| **Cash withdrawal from a non‑JS Bank ATM (1‑Link / M‑Net member)** | **₹ 23.44 per transaction**. |
| **Supplementary (spouse/partner) card for JS Classic** | **₹ 1,500** (once, not annual). |

---

### Quick take‑away

- **The biggest regular cost is the annual fee**, which varies from ₹ 1,400 for a basic PayPak card up to ₹ 12,000 for a JS Platinum card.  
- **Using the card abroad** triggers the 4.5 % transaction fee and a cash‑withdrawal surcharge.  
- **Replacing a lost or damaged card** is essentially the same price as the annual fee, unless you need an emergency replacement abroad (USD 200).  

If you stay within Pakistan and pay your bill on time, you’ll mostly just pay the annual fee (and any optional services like express delivery). International travel or cash‑withdrawals are where the extra percentages kick in. 

Feel free to ask if you want a deeper dive into any specific fee!
